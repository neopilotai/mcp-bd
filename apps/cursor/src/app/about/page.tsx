          <p className="text-[#878787] leading-relaxed text-sm">
            As a bootstrapped company, we believe in sustainable growth and
            maintaining full control over our product vision. We're building our
            platforms thoughtfully, prioritizing user needs over rapid scaling.
            With Midday, we're streamlining business operations, while with
            Languine, we're building localization infrastructure that helps
            fast-paced startups reach global audiences without slowing down
            their development velocity.

            We're deeply committed to open source principles. Both Midday and
            Languine are being built in public, with transparency at their core.
            We believe that collaboration with the community leads to better
            products, and we're proud to contribute back to the open source
            ecosystem. This commitment remains central to our mission, even as
            we grow and evolve.
